1. Learn the basics, so you can navigate and work with projects.  
  a. setup
    Use VS Code as the interface from your desktop to Git and Github.
    Extension are many. 
    https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview this is a good place to start.
  b. repositories  
    Think of a repository as a project. Each project needs a folder to store items.
  c. commits  
    Think of a commit as a save point. You can go back to a commit and start from there.  
    You can also create a branch from a commit. A branch is a copy of the project that you can edit without affecting the original project.
  d. local and remote  
    Local is on your computer. Remote is on the cloud.  
    You can push and pull from local to remote.  
    You can fork and clone from remote to local.

  a. Forking a repository  
      i. done in the cloud  
  b. Cloning a fork  
      i. done on the laptop  
      ii. When you clone, it will create a diretory for the   files, so run the clone command from the parent   directory.
