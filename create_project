How to create a new project?

1. Create a folder inside your top-level folder to hold the project documents.
  1a. My top-level is 'projects'.
  1b. For this example, create 'new_project' in 'projects' folder
2. Create a file, like this one, that contains info for your project.
  # These notes are modified or copied directly from:
  # https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github
3. Create a git repository to track this project.
  A lot of options other than git, but I'm going to show git to keep it simple.
  3a. $ git init -b main
  3b. $ git add .
    # Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit.
    # To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
  3c. $ git commit -m "First commit"
      # Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a
      # remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file,
      # use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
4. Create the web repository in github to receive the local project files.
  4a. At the top of your repository on GitHub.com's Quick Setup page, click  to copy the remote repository URL.

5. push local files to web repository.
  5b. $ git remote add origin git@github.com:gregdyche/github101.git
    # URL is built from 'git@github.com' and your username separate by a :
    # followed by a / and then your repository name. 
  5c. $ git branch -M main
  5d. $ git push -u origin main
